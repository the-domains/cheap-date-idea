Cheap date idea  \#1 Visit the botanical gardens. 

Step 1: Do a quick google maps search for botanical gardens, then check out their website to make sure that you will be visiting a garden and not a nursery. 

Step 2: Grab an ice chest throw in a salad plus anything your want that's good for a picnic. 

Step 3a: IMPORTANT! Leave for the garden 3 hours before sunset. This way you will arrive with just an hour and a half to walk around before the park closes and you have to leave. This way you will have  a need to return for a second more through visit. 

Step 3b. After you leave the Garden with only an hour left go find a good view of the sunset. Suggestions are the top of a hill out of town or the beach. But if you are in a bind remember that the top of any parking garage has an amazing view!

There it is Cheap Date \#1 Stay tuned for \#2
