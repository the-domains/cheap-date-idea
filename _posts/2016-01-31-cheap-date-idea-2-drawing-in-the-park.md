Practice drawing at the park. This one is suitable for all levels. 

Step 1: Go to our favorite bookstore Barns and Nobel, while you are there check out one of these awesome adult drawing books. They are not expensive and can be a challenge. 

Step 2: Go to the park, sit at a bench and start drawing stuff. The art book trainer will have tons of great starts, to help you get creative. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4d589d3f-71a3-480b-96c7-e8d0c84b1d6e.jpg)

Recommended - Bring a picnic. Twenty dollars before you leave to fill up an ice box is going to save you 40 on lunch plus help your date go smoothly.
