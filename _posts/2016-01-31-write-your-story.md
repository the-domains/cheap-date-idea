Write a book together.

This might seem silly but... it is not at all silly. 

Let me digress my Ex's father kept a diary of his youth it included excerpts from the war, letters to his (Now) wife and countless other stories. Long story short we red the diary one month and it was amazing. Now I keep a diary. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7722218e-1287-448d-8b39-55574e43fb33.jpg)

Back to the subject if you keep a diary with your partner then you will have written proof of your dating years you will have a story to hand your grand kids.
